Analyzing the valence of the U.S. Great Lakes

## Methodologies
My goal was to analyze the public's sentiment towards each of the U.S. Great Lakes. There is a large Erie vs. Superior debate in our household, and I decided to test my personal hypothesis that, like it's name, Lake Superior is the most admirable of the lakes. I gathered a recent set of tweets about each lake and used the lexicon described below to score each lake. My plans include a more robust analysis, including logitudinal data, when time allows.

After considerable research into various tools for sentiment analysis, I chose to use the included lexicon by Warriner & Kuperman. This decision came about due to the comprehensiveness of their lexicon and the relative reliability of their methods. A reference to the source of their dataset is listed below. Although a lexicon is not ideal in jargon-filled text such as a Twitter mine, it was chosen for its simplicity in an example setting.

## Conclusions
Judging based on mean scores, Lake Superior is indeed superior to Lake Erie, though it is not the highest rated of all lakes. Additionally, the gap between the two lakes in question is not as large as I'd comfortably like it to be. Hopefully, with increased analysis, a clearer outcome will be discovered.
